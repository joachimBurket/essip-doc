Appropriate topics for documentation often include:

* General introduction to the library. The introduction particularly needs to include:
* A very high-level overview of what the library is good for, and perhaps what it isn't good for, understandable even by those with no prior knowledge of the problem domain.
* The simplest possible ("hello world") example of using the library.
* Tutorial covering basic use cases.
* Reference documentation:
* Description of each class.
* Relationship between classes.
* For each function, as applicable, description, requirements (preconditions), effects, post-conditions, returns, and throws.
* Discussion of error detection and recovery strategy.
* How to compile and link.
* How to test.
* Version or revision history.
